    question:
      "What is the difference between wired and wireless home automation systems, and which one is better for my home?",
    answer:
      "Wired systems offer more reliable and faster communication but require extensive installation and wiring. Wireless systems are easier to install and more flexible but may have slight latency. The best choice depends on your home's construction, budget, and specific needs. Wired is ideal for new constructions, while wireless suits existing homes better.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How much does it cost to install a home automation system, and are there any ongoing fees?",
    answer:
      "The cost varies based on system complexity, ranging from basic setups ($500-$1,500) to comprehensive solutions ($5,000+). Installation costs depend on your home's size and chosen features. Monthly fees may apply for cloud services or advanced features, typically $10-$30/month, though many basic functions work without subscription.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can I control my home automation system remotely (e.g., via smartphone or voice assistants)?",
    answer:
      "Yes, our home automation systems can be controlled remotely through our secure mobile app. You can manage lights, security, temperature, and other connected devices from anywhere with an internet connection. The systems are also compatible with popular voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What happens if the internet or power goes out? Will my system still work?",
    answer:
      "Most critical functions continue working during internet outages as they operate on local networks. During power outages, essential features remain operational through backup batteries. Security systems typically have 24-48 hour backup power. We recommend having a backup power supply for critical systems.",
